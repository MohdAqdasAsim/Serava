        14. Startup Status & Disclaimer Regarding Certificates
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Serava is not a registered company or licensed healthcare provider. We
        are a small, independent startup dedicated to building innovative tools
        that support emotional well-being. While we take privacy and ethical
        development seriously, we operate without formal institutional backing
        or government certification at this stage.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Any digital certificates, badges, or acknowledgements provided within
        the app (such as progress milestones, affirmation badges, or completion
        tokens) are for personal encouragement and do not constitute officially
        recognized credentials or licenses. These are symbolic and meant to
        celebrate your journey — not to imply clinical validation, therapeutic
        accreditation, or academic achievement.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        We aim to grow responsibly and transparently. As we evolve, we may seek
        partnerships, certifications, or formal registration. Until then, your
        trust and feedback mean the world to us.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">
        15. Certificate Disclaimer
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Serava may occasionally offer digital certificates or acknowledgments to
        select users, such as early testers, to celebrate their contributions or
        milestones. These certificates may be sent via email and are intended
        solely as tokens of appreciation and encouragement.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Please note that these certificates do <strong>not</strong> carry any
        formal academic, professional, or therapeutic accreditation. They are
        not issued by any recognized authority and should not be used as proof
        of training, expertise, or participation in any licensed program.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        We're a small startup building from the heart — and these certificates
        are simply one way we say thank you for walking this journey with us.
      </p>

      <div className="mt-12 text-sm text-zinc-500 italic">

        it. You’re the author of your peace.”
